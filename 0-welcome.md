# Learning Data Structures
Welcome to this tutorial!  In this tutorial we will be learning about three different data structures:

1. [Stacks]()
2. [Sets]()
3. [Tree]()

Each module will explain each data structure and give an example and a practice problem to complete.  Each practice problem will have a solution after you complete the task.
